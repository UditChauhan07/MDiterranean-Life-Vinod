          <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
          <p>
            The Bruno Pharma Site uses &quot;cookies&quot; to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a
            text file that is placed on your hard disk by a webpage server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or
            deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a web server
            in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of
            a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you
            personalize Bruno Pharma pages, or register with the Bruno Pharma Site and/or Services, cookies are used to
            recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your
            personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same
            Site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Site’s and/or
            Service’s features that you customized.
          </p>

          <p>
            You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you
            can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies,
            you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Bruno Pharma Site you visit and/or
            Services you use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Advertisements that appear on our Site and/or through our Services may be delivered to users by advertising
            partners, who may set cookies. This permits the ad server to recognize your computer whenever an online
            advertisement is sent to you. This information is then compiled and allows the delivery of targeted
            advertisements that are supposed to be of interest to you. This Privacy Policy only covers the use of
            cookies by us alone and does not cover the use of cookies by advertisers.
